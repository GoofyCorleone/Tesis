## 📘 Overview

This repository contains the complete digital source materials for my Master's thesis in Theoretical Quantum Optics and Quantum Field Theory. The work explores [brief mention of core theme, e.g., "entanglement generation in coupled cavity arrays," "the Unruh effect in analog systems," "open quantum systems approaches to decoherence"].

The repository is structured to ensure transparency, reproducibility of figures, and archival permanence for the theoretical derivations and results presented.

## 🔬 Thesis Abstract

*A placeholder for your abstract. Typically 200-300 words summarizing the problem, theoretical framework, key findings, and implications.*

> **Example:** This thesis investigates the non-equilibrium dynamics of an impurity coupled to a structured bosonic reservoir, modeled within the framework of the spin-boson model with spectral density \( J(\omega) \sim \omega^s \). Employing a combination of analytical path-integral techniques (Leggett et al.) and numerical tensor network simulations (Time-Evolving Block Decentralization), we characterize the localization-delocalization transition for sub-Ohmic (\(s < 1\)) baths. A key result is the identification of a novel multi-time correlation structure in the localized phase, with direct implications for quantum memory applications. Furthermore, we propose an analog quantum simulation protocol for this model using trapped ions in a tailored spectral environment.

## 🛠️ Compiling the Thesis

The document is written in LaTeX and uses standard packages for physics (`physics`, `amssymb`) and mathematics (`amsmath`). For typesetting quantum mechanics, it may use `braket`.

### Prerequisites
- A full LaTeX distribution (e.g., [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/), [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/), or [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/)).
- The following LaTeX packages (usually included in full distributions):
  - `amsmath`, `amssymb`, `amsthm`
  - `geometry`, `hyperref`, `graphicx`
  - `physics`, `braket`
  - `booktabs`, `siunitx`
- For bibliography management: `biblatex` (with backend `biber`) or `natbib`.

### Compilation Instructions

Using the command line in the `Thesis/` directory:

```bash
# 1. Compile LaTeX, generate bibliography, recompile (standard biblatex/biber workflow)
pdflatex main.tex
biber main
pdflatex main.tex
pdflatex main.tex  # For resolved references

# Or use the latexmk tool (recommended for automation)
latexmk -pdf -pdflatex="pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode" -bibtex main.tex
```

The final PDF will be generated as `Thesis/main.pdf`.

## 🎨 Figures Source

All schematic diagrams, theoretical plots (concept diagrams, not data plots), and custom illustrations are created as vector graphics using **[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)** and stored as `.svg` files in the `Figures_Source/` directory.

- **Why SVG?** Vector graphics are infinitely scalable, editable, and produce crisp results in the final PDF at any resolution.
- **Organization:** Figures are grouped by chapter for easy navigation.
- **Naming Convention:** Descriptive names (e.g., `keldysh_contour.svg`, `hbn_layer_structure.svg`).
- **Inclusion in LaTeX:** The compiled figures in `Thesis/figures/` are in PDF or PNG format. To re-export from source:
  1. Open `.svg` file in Inkscape.
  2. *File → Save As...* and choose "PDF" (for LaTeX with `\includegraphics`) or "PNG" (set high DPI, e.g., 300).
  3. Save to the appropriate `Thesis/figures/` subdirectory.

## 📚 Theoretical Context & Key Tools

- **Primary Theoretical Framework:** Quantum Optics, Quantum Field Theory (QFT)
- **Mathematical Tools:** Second Quantization, Green's Functions, Master Equations (Lindblad, GKSL), Path Integrals (Schwinger-Keldysh contour)
- **Concepts Explored:** [e.g., Coherence, Entanglement, Quantum Vacuum, Open Quantum Systems, Analog Models]
- **Notation:** Follows standard conventions (e.g., \(\hat{a}^\dagger\) for creation operator, \(c=\hbar=1\) natural units where applicable).
